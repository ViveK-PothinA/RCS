Fully functional code for gesture controlled arm. 
The arm was built of plastic sheet and servo motors.

Using MPU-6050(Accelometer and Gyroscope), RF module and Arduino. hand gestures were detected and info was sent to the arm.

The three folders contain arduino code for:
1. Sensing data from gyroscope and transmitting necessary data
2. Receiving data
3. Servo control
