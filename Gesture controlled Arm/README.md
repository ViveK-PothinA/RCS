Fully functional code for gesture controlled arm. 
The arm was built of thick plastic sheet and servo motors.

Using MPU-6050(Accelometer and Gyroscope) with arduino(equipped with RF transmitter), hand gestures were detected and info was sent to another arduino with RF reciever.

The three folders contain arduino code for:
* Sensing data from gyroscope and transmitting necessary data
* Receiving data
* Servo control
