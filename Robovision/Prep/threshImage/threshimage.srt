Hello, and welcome to today's tutorial on image processing

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:10,570
In today's tutorial we'll be learning a very important function called thresholding

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:18,570
Thresholding, basically is used when we know the range in which the pixel value we need exists

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,570
and want to cut out the rest of the image

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:26,570
For example, in this image. let's say we want to display only the lion and to subtract the background

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,570
Let us see how to do that

7
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,570
In order to do that

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,570
Let us open fileImage.py and edit it

9
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:40,570
Let us first save this as threshimage.py

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,570
Now, we need to change the processing section 

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:55,570
The first thing we need to do is convert this from an image that has BGR format into an image that is of a grayscale format

12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:01,570
To do that we use the familiar command gray=cv2.cvtColor

13
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,570
Now the next thing we need to do is to threshold the image

14
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,570
In order to do that we use the command cv2.threshold

15
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:17,570
In this command, thresh1 is the new matrix in which the thresholded image is stored

16
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,570
and gray is the image that we are trying to do the threshold upon

17
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:27,570
150 is the value below which we want everything to turn black

18
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,570
and the things above 150 we want to make it white

19
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,570
In order to mae it white we must specify the value as 255

20
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,570
and finally the type of thresholding we are doing is binary

21
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,570
because in the resultant image there will be only 2 values

22
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,570
either 0 or 255 

23
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:53,570
those pixels that have a value below 150 will be set to 0 and those pixels above will be set to 255

24
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,570
Now we need to show the output of this thresholding

25
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,570
So let us say

26
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:11,570
cv2.imshow, image as thresh1 and the image that we want to display as thresh1

27
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,570
and imag is the original image that we have

28
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,570
let us save this and see the output of this program

29
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:28,570
as you can see now we have this original image out of which the backround has been totally subtracted

30
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,570
because it is dark and only the lion is visible

31
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:36,570
Suppose we want to have more portion of the lion visible

32
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,570
that means we need to set our threshold lower

33
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,570
Let's see how we can do this

34
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,570
instead of 150 here I am going to givr an argument of 100

35
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,570
Let us save and see what happens

36
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:56,570
As you can see now more areas of the lion that were earlier darker are now visible

37
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,570
This is how thresholding works

38
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:05,570
that means that these pixels where it is white were above the value 100 and those that are black

39
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,570
are below the value 100

40
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:13,570
There are many different types of thresholding that are available to us through opencv

41
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,570
Let us see what they are

42
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:21,570
The first one as we have seen is THRESH_BINARY

43
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,570
The second one is called THRESH_BINARY_INV

44
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,570
where it inverts the value that we have chosen

45
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,570
Let me set the threshold to be the same so that we can compare all these kinds of thresholding

46
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:40,570
the third is called THRESH_TRUNC where it truncates the values that are below 

47
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,570
and once above it least intact

48
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,570
the next type of thresholding is THRESH_TOZERO

49
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,570
and finally the fifth type is THRESH_TOZERO_INV

50
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:58,570
it is easier to see the output and understand what these individual kind of threshold do

51
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,570
than to explain them

52
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,570
so let's go ahead and see what they look like

53
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,570
In order to do that I must display all the output that are generated

54
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:13,570
so, therefore al I am going to do is copy paste this line and chaneg all the values

55
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,570
to the matrices that we want to display

56
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:20,570
which is thresh1,thresh2,thresh3,thresh4,thresh5

57
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,570
and accordingly display them in different windows

58
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,570
Alright, now let's see what the output of this program looks like

59
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,570
OK

60
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,570
As you can see now we have five different types of thresholdings

61
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,570
Firstly, this is the reference image that we have

62
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:48,570
This is the threshold that we have already seen which is binary

63
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,570
this is binary inverse

64
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,570
which is basically, just the opposite of binary

65
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,570
The next type of truncation that we see is trunct_zero

66
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,570
the next on is trunct_zero_inverse

67
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,570
and finally we have this

68
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,570
In order to recap,the kind of thresholds we have

69
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,570
are THRESH_BINARY

70
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,570
THRESH_BINARY_INV

71
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,570
THRESH_TRUNC

72
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,570
THRESH_TOZERO

73
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,570
and finally THRESH_TOZERO_INV

74
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,570
that's all for today's lecture. See you next time
